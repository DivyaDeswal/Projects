# Project 1
# Bank Transaction Fraud Detection

## 📌 Objective

Detect fraudulent transactions in banking systems to prevent financial fraud and enhance security.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

Machine Learning Classification Models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

XGBoost

Neural Networks

## 🎯 Use Case

This project helps banks and financial institutions identify suspicious transactions and mitigate fraudulent activities, ensuring secure financial transactions.

## 🔍 Implementation

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning

Preprocessed financial transaction data.

Removed null values and handled imbalanced classes using techniques like SMOTE.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization

Used histograms and correlation heatmaps to identify fraud patterns.

Visualized transaction distributions to detect anomalies.

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Created new features such as:

Transaction frequency per user.

Customer spending behavior over time.

Time-based transaction patterns.

### 4️⃣ Model Implementation

Implemented multiple classifiers to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Compared different models based on performance metrics.

### 5️⃣ Performance Evaluation

Evaluated models using:

Accuracy

Precision-Recall Score

ROC-AUC Curve

Confusion Matrix

# Project 2
# Mobile Recommendation System
A recommendation engine that suggests mobile phones based on user preferences.

## 📊 Project Details

### 🔹 Mobile Recommendation System

The Mobile Recommendation System is designed to help users find the best mobile phones based on their preferences. The system analyzes key attributes of mobile devices, such as:

Price Range: Budget, mid-range, or premium segment.

Technical Specifications: RAM, storage capacity, battery life, and processor speed.

User Preferences: Camera quality, brand preference, screen size, and operating system.

Feature Prioritization: AI-driven ranking based on user importance weightage.

### 📌 How It Works

Data Collection: The system utilizes a dataset containing specifications of various mobile phones.

Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features such as performance, display quality, and user reviews.

Content-Based Filtering: Compares phone attributes to user preferences and recommends the most suitable options.

Machine Learning Models: Uses similarity-based techniques like Cosine Similarity, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and collaborative filtering.

Output Recommendations: Presents a ranked list of recommended mobile phones based on the user's needs.

### 🔬 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for data processing and modeling.

Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation.

Machine Learning Algorithms for recommendation logic.

### 📝 Future Improvements

Enhance recommendation accuracy using hybrid filtering (content + collaborative).

Integrate deep learning for personalized suggestions.

Implement a web-based UI for easy user interaction.
