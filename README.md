# Bank Transaction Fraud Detection

#### Objective: 
Detect fraudulent transactions in banking systems to prevent financial fraud.

#### Techniques Used: 
Machine learning classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

#### Use Case: 
Helps banks and financial institutions identify suspicious transactions and reduce fraudulent activities.

#### Implementation:

Data Collection & Cleaning: Preprocessed financial transaction data by removing null values and handling imbalanced classes.

EDA & Visualization: Used histograms and correlation heatmaps to identify fraud patterns.

Feature Engineering: Created new features like transaction frequency and customer spending behavior.

#### Modeling:
Implemented various classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks) to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

#### Performance Evaluation: 
Compared model accuracy, precision-recall, and ROC curves to select the best-performing classifier.
